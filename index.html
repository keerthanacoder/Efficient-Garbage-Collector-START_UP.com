                The name of our company is <i><b>“Garb-Tech”</b></i> and we have designed a ‘Smart Garbage
                Collection System’ which has the ability to alert the dumping trucks about the over flooding
                garbage bins. We have created a technologically sound garbage collection system by utilising
                technological concepts involving networking and IoT (Internet of Things) and aim to use this
                proposed technological product for creating a service-providing business. Our proposed
                product addresses the problem of waste management especially in countries like India where
                a lot of waste is generated daily. Our project is proposed to provide an efficient way of
                avoiding over flooding of garbage bins.Apart from the product, our proposed business also provides waste
                collection service which
                will enable us to operate as an independent waste management company. The provision of
                service would include garbage collection service, garbage dumping service and product
                maintenance service. Our services are also expected to generate revenue for the business by
                selling collected garbage to recycling plants

        <h1>How we started</h1>
        <div class="row1">
            <div class="row">
                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    There are certain basic needs for every consumer irrespective of his/her nationality and
                    lifestyle. We specifically wanted to focus on those needs as it would provide large amount of
                    consumers to our product or service In India, waste management is a major issue. Our
                    country is ranked 23rd in global pollution rankings. Among the top 15 polluted cities in the
                    world, 14 are in India. These are the facts that drew our attention towards this problem.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to make India clean again by efficient management of waste with the use of
                    technology. We tried to find out the existing waste management solutions currently being
                    implemented, but we found that manual waste collection without any technological aid is the
                    only way of garbage collection in our country. Therefore, we decided to take inefficient
                    garbage collection and urgent need for cleanliness as our opportunity to build a product and
                    service to address this issue.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    The strategy we will be following is plain and simple. Initially we will carry out Just-InTime
                    production process. Just in Time (JIT), as the name suggests, is a management
                    philosophy that calls for the production of what the customer wants, when they want it, in the
                    quantities requested, where they want it, without it being delayed in inventory.Once our business
                    takes
                    off and the local municipalities approve of it, we can go for mass
                    production.</p>

            <h1>About the Company</h1><br>
            <p>The Company <i>GARBTECH</i> shall be a product oriented start up that aims to create a smart
                waste management system through which we can provide an efficient solution to the problem
                of waste accumulation and over flooding of garbage bins. The project is aimed to generate
                alerts and assist the waste dumping authorities for regular and proper waste collection from
                garbage bins through our proposed technological product with the target locations being
                urban areas with dense population as well as rural areas with high population.Our biggest competitor
                will be the government or some private agencies who collect waste
                and lead to their disposal. There is a company called Bigbelly which does similar kind of
                work which we do but their dustbin is too costly which is not feasible to be installed in India.

                    We have proposed a product based business idea with the functionality of providing services
                    to the garbage collection authorities. Our Proposed business is unique as there is no available
                    product implementation as well as any service oriented to it, so in an environment free of any
                    competition, we can undergo product development and further use the product to create a
                    garbage collection service as a business.Operating planning plays a vital role in determining the
                    profits of a company. We propose a
                    systematic and regular control over the production and supply of our product by
                    implementing various techniques.We plan to employ rag pickers to collect the disposed plastics from
                    various parts of the city
                    as we utilise it for recycling followed by remoulding into a garbage can. Also the various
                    electronic components will be imported from a specialised vendor on a contract basis.We will employ
                    an
                    on board inspector who will ensure the quality of the workflow and the
                    final assembly of the product. We also plan to implement a system to receive regular updates
                    from the clients on the feedback of our product.
                    The quantity of all the materials we use will be kept track of in a manual process of logging it
                    after each product is made or moved from the plant. Our inventory items include: Garbage
                    Detection Device, Garbage Bins and Garbage Collection Trucks.
                    Our expansion policy also includes opening up several distribution channels for selling the
                    product. E-commerce websites and door – to – door sales are our next targeted product
                    distribution channels for the expansion of product into every nook and corner. However, we
                    will also take care of intra-channel and inter-channel conflicts in our distribution system.Garbage
                    segregation mechanism can be built in the dustbin itself in which with the help of
                    image processing the waste can be automatically segregated into biodegradable and
                    nonbiodegradable.In future we can take care of the disposal part of the waste management as well,
                    like we can
                    tend the tender of the waste disposal and recycling.

                    <h3>Strategy and implementation summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main strength in our business is that our proposed product is unique in its
                        application.Existence of a large market for our product is another major strength of our
                        product. Our
                        potential markets are households and government which are surely available in our
                        country.Absence of any significant competitors serves as strength to our product. The only
                        competitor is the existent non – technical garbage collection system which is expected to
                        be weak due to lack of proper administration and technology utilisation.The only observed
                        weakness of our business is that there is no traditional buyer for our
                        product as the product is first in its category (technology based garbage collection). The
                        potential buyers of our product are individuals and government which are needed to be
                        made aware of the technical advantage of this product.Our business has several opportunities to
                        become an early bloomer in the market. The
                        most certain opportunity is to grasp government’s attention regarding the product’s ability
                        to avoid land pollution. Being the first to present this idea would help us to become a
                        trusted partner of the government.
                        The second opportunity is to gain financial aid through subsidised loans and taxes from
                        the government by illustrating the environmental advantages of our product.It is obvious that a
                        unique idea based venture attracts many competitors to enter the market
                        with the products providing same functionalities. So, new competitors are a threat to our
                        existing product.
                        Rejection of service is another threat to our business. In case of unawareness about the
                        product and related services and low quality services, the customers lose trust on the
                        product and company. So, it is also a threat to our business.

                    <h3>Market Analysis summary</h3>
                    <p>The number of garbage bins installed is increasing as per the “Swacchta Abhiyaan” policy.
                        Garbage bins are already installed in major cities like Mumbai and New Delhi. The parks and
                        other public places often have private or public dustbins.
                        Our potential market is all those areas where the garbage bins are installed or yet to be
                        installed. Thus, our market is quite large and every person who uses garbage bin is our
                        potential customer. In the current state of our nation, the people living in urban areas have
                        more usage of garbage bins than people living in rural areas but due to nationwide “Swacch
                        Bharata Abhiyaan”, the number of users of garbage bins is expected to increase in the coming
                        years.
                        We estimate that about 60% of our total units would be purchased by households and 40% by
                        the private colony owners, NGOs, local businesses and government for installation in public
                        places. This observation of the market by us would decide the marketing as well as the
                        pricing strategy for our product and services.</p>

                    <h3>Management summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        As our proposed business structure has the capability to product based as well as service
                        based, we need a management model having high discipline and concentrated supervision on
                        company’s activities. Therefore, we have decided to adopt tall (centralised) organisation
                        structure.
